# Introduction to NumPy:
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
- It is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
- Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- Offers a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

**Why NumPy is popular to use?**
- *Efficiency:** Implemented in C and optimized for performance.
- *Functionality:** Offers complex mathematical operations and random number capabilities.
- *Ease of Use:** Provides a high-level syntax that makes it accessible.

**Basic/Core Concepts of Numpy:**
- *Arrays:* Core concept in NumPy. It's similar to lists in Python but can have multiple dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).
- *Vectorization:* Process of implementing operations on entire arrays rather than their individual elements, which is fast and efficient.
- *Broadcasting:* Set of rules by which NumPy handles arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations.
